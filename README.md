# _GV Language Picker_

#### _create a page to pick which programming language is right for the user_

#### By _**Giancarlo Vigneri**_

### Special thanks to _**Tiffany Greathead, Brandon Magofna, Patrick Lee, Jesse White, Jeremy Banka, and the Epicodus Staff**_

## Technologies Used

* _Git Bash_
* _VS Code_
* _Web Browser_
* _Git Hub_
* _HTML_
* _CSS_
* _Bootstrap_
* _JavaScript_
* _JQuery_
* _Human Brain_
* _the Collective Conscious_


## Description:
_page asks a series of questions via dialog prompts. Simply concatenating the answers together to form a longer string, page then uses the .length method to convert the string into a number. Then the page does a little dumb math follwed by an arbitrary if else if statement and shows a hidden statment._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Navigate to (https://github.com/Bobloblawlobslawbomb/mar26CodeReview)
2. Clone or download 'mar26CodeReview'
3. Double click index.html or right-click, (select 'open with...') and choose which program to open or view files
4. Fight Capitalism 



## Known Bugs

* _'Prevent this page from creating additional dialogs' checkbox appears from answer two prompt onwards. Would like to -- prevent this prevent checkbox_



## Notes

1. _I included COPYING because it seemed to be a needed part of implementing the license_
2. _I realized this week that I need to be coding more often_ 
3. _I am going to submit what I have before the deadline, but it is not much_
4. _Woof. I frustrated myself and even a walk and my celebratory steak dinner,which I had for lunch, didnt help my mood. So I took a break. Then I made myself comfortable and I basically restarted at last weekends' reading_
5. _I just read and worked through the material, actually doing what y'all say to do and using my dang hands and eyes and brain...till 830_
6. EPIPHANY!!!!! -- I got to the bit about setting a string as the response to a prompt and realized radio buttons were breaking my brain!!! The whole day I was trying to get them to give me a value then I'd add += 1 to it or something but I couldnt do it. I know it's not that hard but this would be _simpler_ for me _right now_
7. I basically wrote the whole thing on a scrap of notepad paper real fast, then plopped it into the files. I forgot to $(document).ready(function), anf I realized I was missing an end bracket....then I realized I needed to set the answerX variables before I do the math stuff. IT BASICALLY WORKED 1ST TRY!!!!!!!!
8. _I had to spend the next 45 minutes telling my room-mate the story of my understanding. THEN I pushed the working code to GitHub.
9. _I still have a little work to do but I have 90% and I am stoked. And I have a plan to move forward and be better for myself and my team!_
10. _Had a nice day Saturday, went for a walk around Tabor. Slow start on Sunday, did a few errands, but I'm here now and I just finished editing the superfluous things out of the code and updating the README.  Plan is to push to GitHub, then I HAVE to build this table that has been in the living room all week (or my roommies will not be happy), then CODE! --Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.


## Planned Updates

* _implement confirm funtion as the first question_
* _add list of languages and similar statement to: "Or any other word!"_
* _place box behind prompt dialog boxes_
* _tune evenDumberAnswer or if else statement for more variance_
* _deploy to GitHub pages_
