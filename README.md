## Notes

1. _I included COPYING because it is a part of properly implementing the license_
2. _I realized this week that I need to be coding more often_ 
3. _I am going to submit what I have before the deadline, but it is not much_
4. _Woof. I frustrated myself and even a walk and my celebratory steak dinner,which I had for lunch, didnt help my mood. So I took a break. Then I made myself comfortable and I basically restarted at last weekends' reading_
5. _I just read and worked through the material, actually doing what y'all say to do and using my dang hands and eyes and brain...till 830_
6. EPIPHANY!!!!! -- I got to the bit about setting a string as the response to a prompt and realized radio buttons were breaking my brain!!! The whole day I was trying to get them to give me a value then I'd add += 1 to it or something but I couldnt do it. I know it's not that hard but this would be _simpler_ for me _right now_
7. I basically wrote the whole thing on a scrap of notepad paper real fast, then plopped it into the files. I forgot to $(document).ready(function), anf I realized I was missing an end bracket....then I realized I needed to set the answerX variables before I do the math stuff. IT BASICALLY WORKED 1ST TRY!!!!!!!!
8. _I had to spend the next 45 minutes telling my room-mate the story of my understanding. THEN I pushed the working code to GitHub.
9. _I still have a little work to do but I have 90% and I am stoked. And I have a plan to move forward and be better for myself and my team!_
10. _Had a nice day Saturday, went for a walk around Tabor. Slow start on Sunday, did a few errands, but I'm here now and I just finished editing the superfluous things out of the code and updating the README. And I had to put together this table for the house.
11. The table has been built. Then I rebuilt the picker. It needed a lot of work, but I think I have it in a great place now.

## Planned Updates

* _implement confirm function as the first question_
* _get the page to make try judements of character_
* _deploy to GitHub pages_
